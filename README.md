# s0ck3tSSH
Golang SSH client capable of routing the SSH socket over multiple proxy types

Usage: ```s0ck3tSSH <proxy host> <ssh host> [key]```

## Tested on Windows, OSX, Linux, and FreeBSD.
## Socket routing is based on the github.com/RouterScript/ProxyClient package
## greetz to @CellPhoneDude for the idea

Shell interaction is pretty lazy but it works, all pr's and enhancements welcome.
